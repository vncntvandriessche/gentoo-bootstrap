gentoo-bootstrap
================
This script needs some serious refactoring...

Usage
-----
Check your settings using:
    ./bootstrap
When you are sure everything is ready:
    ./bootstrap --enforce

Soon configuration and installation rules shall be retrieved from other files, making it more organized.

TODOs (deprecated)

Now using the issues...
